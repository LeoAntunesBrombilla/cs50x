This repo is for my solutions on the psets and for the final project for the Harvard Cs50x course online

## Week 1

### Pset 1

On this pset there is 3 tasks, the last 2 tasks have a "harder" version

1. Classic task of prompting "Hello World". <br/>

2. In the second task I have to construct one side of a pyramid like the ones in the classic game Mario using hashes. <br/>
  2.1 The second variation of this problem is to build the two sides of the pyramid. 

3. The third task was to implement, a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made. <br/>

### Pset 2 

On this pset there is two tasks:

1. Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text.

2. Implement a program that implements a substitution cipher, per the below.

### Pset 3

On this pset there is two tasks:

1. Implement a program that runs a plurality election.

Ps: In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

2. Implement a program that runs a runoff election.

Ps: Voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference.
